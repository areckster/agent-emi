Here's the format for how to interact with the model:

<|im_start|>system
You are a helpful assistant


Reasoning effort: low<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
Continue the fibonnaci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
<think>
Just continue: 13,21,34,...
</think>
The Fibonacci sequence continues by adding the two preceding numbers.
After **8** the next term is **13** (1 + 8 = 9 – 1 = 8 + 5 = 13), then **21** (8 + 13 = 21), followed by **34** (13 + 21 = 34), and so on.

So the sequence starts:

**1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, …**<|im_end|>
